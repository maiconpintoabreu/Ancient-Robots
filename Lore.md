## Ancient Robots

After 7000 years, the humans started to notice a different behavior from the automated machines they had created. The robots started to present extra agility and Intellect. They soon started to develop different powers than what they were made for.  For example, they were able to use fire and lead big groups.

With the years passing, one of the robots developed the ability to speak. He called himself "Son of Loki" after destroying the manufacturer where he had been created and hid himself from the world.

Robots in the world started to choose sides, either helping the humans or destroying them. 

The robots helping the humans taught them that their unique abilities are coming from their core materials. They called them "pieces of the old gods". 

Son of Loki, on his side, was not only hiding. He was creating an army to destroy the human cities. His plan succeeded as the current human weapons were not efficient against these superior robots. The human survivors started to gather in small villages with the help of friendly robots.
